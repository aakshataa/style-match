# Style-Match

### Introduction
The fashion industry is increasingly moving towards personalized shopping experiences and greater convenience for consumers. However, finding similar clothing styles based on an image continues to be a significant challenge.  <br>
  <br>
To address this issue, we have developed a platform where users can upload images of clothing articles, and then our program will search through our ZARA clothing database and return items with similar styles!  <br>
  <br>
By allowing users to upload images of clothing articles they like, our platform seeks tostreamline the search process and enhance the shopper experience. This not only saves time for consumers, but  empowers them to explore a wider range of options that match their individual style!
